Before we get started I would just like to say that if you get any errors on beta or RC builds I am not responsible.

Welcome to mOS.
We hope we can help you with your micro:bit experience.

Getting Started.
Download which mOS file you want to install to your microbit.
 
Plug your micro:bit into your computer
 
Drag the mOS file to your micro:bit.
 
It will flash mOS to your microbit and you will be done.

Thank you for checking out this repositiory.
